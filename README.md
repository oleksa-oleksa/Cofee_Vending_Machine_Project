Software Project in C++ Project with GUI.

During the Sommer Semester 2018 the projest was written in C++ using QT Creator. Initially started as a team project of 4 students it was finally implemented by me and a small part of unit tests was created by one student.

It is a software simulation of a coffee vending machine with graphical interface. The free icons was used for the project and a GUI was created directly in QT Creator. There is a software real time simulation of the different actuators and sensors.

For keeping the user records and payment history, the small SQLite Database was implemented using C++; however, the final version runs without a database and the QT project file should be modified to build the project with SQLite.   

The project content:
* Code in C++ created using QT Creator
* Graphical user interface
* Unit Tests for all classes
* Two integration tests
* System test (successful scenario)
* SQLite Database
* Brief specification (German)
* UML Diagrams (Class Diagram, State Diagram, Use Cases, all in German language)

During the Winter Semester 2017-2018 in course Software Engineering 1 the team members wrote the Wiki with project specification and created UML Diagrams (Class, Sequence, Case).
